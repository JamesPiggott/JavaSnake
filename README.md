## Installation
To play the game, just run SnakeChase after you have compiled the code.
The game takes a single argument, an integer, that indicates the speed at which the snake should move. The default value is set to 100, but recommended speed is 20.


##Credits
Snake is derived from an implementation of Worms coded by Andrew Davison for his seminal book 'Killer Game Programming in Java'.
If you want to alter Snake you should read the first four chapter of that book.
